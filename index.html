        <p><b>What is kimchi?</b><br />
            Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made from salted and fermented vegetables, most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radishes. It's known for its pungent, spicy, and sour flavors.<br />
<br />

<!--
<b>What makes kimchi unique:</b><br />
<br />
•  Fermentation: <br />
This is the key process that gives kimchi its distinctive flavor and nutritional benefits. Lacto-fermentation, specifically, produces lactic acid, which gives kimchi its sour taste and helps preserve the vegetables.<br />
-->
<br />
•  Ingredients:<br />
Napa cabbage and Korean radishes are the most common base vegetables.
Other ingredients often include garlic, ginger, scallions, and gochugaru (Korean chili powder).
Fish sauce or other seafood products are sometimes added for umami flavor.<br />
<br />
•  Varieties:'<br />
There are hundreds of different kimchi varieties, depending on the region, season, and specific ingredients used.<br />
<br />
•  Cultural Significance: <br />
Kimchi is a staple of Korean cuisine and has deep cultural significance. It's often served with every meal and is a symbol of Korean identity.<br />
<br />
•  Health Benefits:<br />
Due to the fermentation process, kimchi is rich in probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health. It's also a good source of vitamins and minerals.<br /></p>
