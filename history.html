•  Regional Variations:<br />
Kimchi evolved differently across Korea, with each region contributing unique flavors and ingredients. From fresh, light varieties to heavily spiced versions, the diversity reflects Korea's rich culinary heritage.<br />
<br />
•  Cultural Impact:<br />
Kimjang, the communal tradition of preparing kimchi in bulk for winter, remains a cherished ritual in Korean culture. This practice fosters community bonds and preserves culinary traditions.<br />
